Problems answered:

Problem 2: Small Bump 🪨
qubits: 20
Points: 20
A full classical statevector simulation on a CPU is sufficient here. Try running the circuit end-to-end and inspect the output amplitudes to identify the dominant bitstring.

Problem 7: Rolling Ridge 🏞️
qubits: 46
Points: 70
This circuit can be decomposed into smaller subcircuits. Analyze qubit interaction graphs and factor the problem into parts before recombining the results.

Problem 8: Bold Peak 🏜
qubits: 72
Points: 80
Reuse decomposition and compilation strategies, but expect fewer obvious simplifications. You may need iterative refinement.

Problem 9: Grand Summit 🏔️
qubits: 56
Points: 90
This challenge blends multiple patterns from earlier problems. Combine visual inspection, partial simulation, decomposition, and compilation tricks to expose the hidden bias toward the peak bitstring.
